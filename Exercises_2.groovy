Concept\tPython\tGroovy
Function\tA standalone block of code, not tied to a class\tGroovy calls these "script methods" when defined outside of a class
Method\tA function defined inside a class\tSame in Groovy â€” a method inside a class
Instantiation\tFunctions don't require a class instance; methods do\tSame idea, unless method is static
